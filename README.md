# Progress report
## Group:
Name: Yitong LIN <br>
Name: Huashan ZENG <br>

## Progress
* Decided the topic: How to write a popular article for the author
* The website we want to scrape: 人人都是产品经理
* The data we want to collect: article title, author, reading amount, like, comment, collection, etc.

## Bottleneck
* The current idea is still not convincing enough. How can we deepen it?
* Do we need to compare to website's data if it can make the conclusion more comprehensive?

## Tentative story line
Maybe the data we analysing can tell us that which industry is popular now.
